## Conclusion

To conclude, this project not only made me understand and be able to utilize the computational tools used in reproducible and collaborative data science, it also made me realize how important having reproducible work is. Through the use of the Markdown, pandoc, Makefile, Git and GitHub, this project could be easily shared and reproduced for learning purposes. Learning the tools is a fundamental step before we can start thinking about the creation of meaningful reproducible data science work.
