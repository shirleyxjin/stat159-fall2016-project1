## Introduction

Reproducible workflow is becoming increasingly important in many areas of studies where people are paying closer attention to the validity and replicability of analysis performed supporting research results and findings. Reproducible work not only helps the academics examine and verify research progress, but also can be used to improve the overall analysis capability. Computational tools such as **bash**, **Markdown**, **pandoc**, **Git**, **GitHub**, **Makefile**, and text editors such as **Vim**, therefore, are becoming more important and valuable as they make the reproducibility of workflow much easier and more convenient to accomplish. In this paper, I will briefly discuss the roles of some of these computational tools, and detail the challenges in using such tools.
